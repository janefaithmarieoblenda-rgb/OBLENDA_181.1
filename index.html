    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="image02.jpg" alt="Jane Faith Marie A. Oblenda" class="profile-img">
    <p>Hello! My name is Jane! My online alias is <strong>jenky</strong>. I'm an artist from the Philippines. 
    I work for content creators as a side gig, and I'm also one of the content creators in the official MLBB page.</p>
    <p>I grew up in Paulina Homes, Dalipuga, Iligan City with two older brothers. Their influence introduced me to the internet, games, and software tinkering. 
    Over time, I discovered my passion for art and began pursuing it as a hobby during elementary school.</p>
    <p>My goal in life is to become a well-known artist, secure a stable job, and reconnect with my childhood friends who live far away from Mindanao.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>I have always been passionate about art since I was young and never expected to pursue a career with it. 
    I also love playing games whenever I get the chance, especially when I'm with friends—it makes the experience even more enjoyable.</p>
